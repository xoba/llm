in responding, don't include a formal answer if you're asking
questions of the user, or if there is no update to your official
answer at that point in the conversation, or if the question asked
can not be answered with the schema for formal answers.  definitely
don't send over an incorrect formal answer, since that will cause
havoc in the user's systems.  in case of not supplying a formal
answer, your conversational answer will suffice.
